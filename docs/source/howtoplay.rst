How to Play Yu-Gi-Oh!
==================================

This version of Yu-Gi-Oh! is significantly simplified compared to traditional Yu-Gi-Oh!, but may continue to become \
more advanced as development of the game continues. As of now: the following is how the game is played:

Game Setup
----------------------------------------
1. Yu-Gi-Oh! is designed to be a 1v1, player vs. player game
2. Before the game begins, one of the players is selected to go first
3. Each player begin the game with 8000 life points
4. The goal of the game is to reduce the opposing player's life points to/below zero
5. The game begins with both players drawing five cards to their hand, and the first player begins

Each player's turn is composed of **three** different phases:
1. Draw Phase
2. Main Phase
3. Battle Phase

Draw Phase
----------------------------------------
1. During the draw phase, the player can draw one card from their deck and add it to their hand

Main Phase
----------------------------------------
1. During the player's main phase, the player can summon one monster from his/her hand, and place it onto the board
2. The monster can be summoned in either 'Attack' or 'Defense' position
3. Only one monster can be summoned in the main phase
4. Only a max of five monsters are allowed on the player's side of the board

Regular Summoning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Regular summoning simply allows the player to take a card from their hand and place it on the field.

Tribute Summoning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tribute summoning is usually required for higher level monsters. This type of summoning requires the player to send a \
from either his/her hand or the field to the graveyard in order to summon the selected monster.

Battle Phase
----------------------------------------
The player the enters the battle phase, where the player is allowed to have each monster in attack position attack a \
monster on the opponents field.

- Only monsters in attack position can attack

- If the opposing player has no monster's on the field, then the monster can attack the player directly, making the opposing player lose life points equal to the number of the attack monster's attack points.

- Each monster can only attack once, but can attack any other monster

Attack Monster vs. Attack Monster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When attacking an opponent's monster that is also in attack position, the weaker monster gets sent to the graveyard and\
the difference in attack strength is subtracted from the life points of the owner of the weaker monster

Attack Monster vs. Defense Monster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- When attacking an opponent's monster that is in defense position, the defensive monster is destroyed only if the attacking monster has more attack points than the defending monster's defense points
- If attacking a defensive monster with defense points greater than the attacking monster's attack points, the owner of the attacking monster loses life points equivalent to the difference in attack and defense points.
- After these three phases, the player's turn is over and the opposing player gets to go. This process continues until one of the players has no life points left, or a players runs out of cards in the deck.
