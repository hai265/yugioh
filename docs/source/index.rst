Welcome to Yu-Gi-Oh! in Python
==================================

What is Yu-Gi-Oh!?
----------------------------------
**Yu-Gi-Oh!** is a card game that is based of the popular Japanese animated series called Yu-Gi-Oh!. The game consists \
of players creating custom decks from various different monster, spell, and trap cards and battling each other. The are\
thousands are different types of Yu-Gi-Oh! playing cards, allowing for various diverse decks and games.

With the evolution of the Yu-Gi-Oh! show along with various spin-offs coming out like Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, \
Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V, the card game has greatly developed in its play style.

Project Background
----------------------------------
We decided to re-create Yu-Gi-Oh! for our CMSC435: Software Engineering class here at the University of Maryland. This \
project is focused on implementing a simplified version of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card game, primarily through Python. To support \
he development and functionality of the game, we wll also will be implementing the game with the help of HTML, CSS, \
JavaScript, and SQL.

The Yu-Gi-Oh! card game has come quite intricate over the course of the show and the numerous spin offs. For the \
purposes of our project, we will be using the original rule set from the Yu-Gi-Oh! game and will only be using monster \
cards for the game. Perhaps as the development continues, it is possible that we will continue expanding the bounds of \
our Yu-Gi-Oh! game.

How to Use Our Software
----------------------------------
As the development stands right now, there will be a primary way for users to use this software and a secondary, less \
developed way. The primary way to play the game will be through a web-portal UI where users can create an account, \
log in, and battle with other players.

The secondary method would be through a command-line interface, however this method will only be used for preliminary \
stages of development.
